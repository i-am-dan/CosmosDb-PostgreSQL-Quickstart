# CosmosDb for PostgreSQL with React

This repo is created to help those who want to learn how to integrate CosmosDB for PostgreSQL into their React app. 

This repo originated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) repo from Facebook.

We added [Quickstart App - NodeJS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/postgresql/quickstart-app-stacks-nodejs) to modify the code.


## `React` folder
This contains the UI code.

## `Server` folder
This contains the backend server code to interact with CosmosDB for PostgreSQL

## **Locally** - Getting Started
1. Run `npm install` in both the `React` and `Server` folder.
1. Then `npm start` inside the `React` folder.
2. Then `node index.js` inside the `Server` folder.

## **Deployment** - Getting Started
